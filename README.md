# NUC3d: NUmerical Calculator 3 Dimensional

This project is aimed at developing a block structured three dimensional parallel compressible flow solver. 

Previously developped NUC3d code has been successfully used to simulate roughness induced boundary layer transition on over 400 CPUs. However, some stability issues shall be resolved.

**The NUC3d code is currently under reconstructing:**

- A framework for general types of data will be developped.
- High order finite volume method will be supported.
- Algorithms will be optimized for faster computation.
- The MPI communication methods will be optimized.
