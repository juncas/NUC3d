# NUC3d: NUmerical Calculator 3 Dimensional

This project is aimed at developing a block structured three dimensional parallel compressible flow solver. 

Previous developped code has been used to simulate roughness induced boundary layer transition.

 

Coding should be finished before Oct. 30 2015.

- Debugging and testing should be finished before Nov 31 2015.
- ebugging and testing for parallel Euler solver is undergoing. New bc functions are updated to admitt complicate boundaries. 2015 11 22
